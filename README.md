# AzureTasksGenerator

It is a console app that duplicate your current sprint's PBI into task. The purpose is to automate the tasks creation, using your PBI informations.
This is usefull because some organisation write pbi but need task to be able to use the main Azure feature to manage your team/sprint.

You can edit the organization and project from the code if you need.

## Using

The only condition for this app to works fine, is to be sure you want to duplicate your PBI into task and you MUST be in your current sprint. YOU CAN NOT CHOSE A SPRINT BUT ONLY TAKE YOUR CURRENT ONE.
